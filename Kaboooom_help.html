    <p>Kaboooom! is a simple version of a minesweeper like game.  In this version, there is a 15 x 9 mine
	   field used and player starts in upper left corner and must make it to the lower right corner to
	   win the game.  At each position, the count of how many bombs/mines around the players current
	   position is displayed.  When starting a new game, the game will not generate mines completely
	   surrounding the start position nor completely surrounding the end position.  Once you reach the
	   lower right corner (home), the game is over and you win.  If you hit a bomb on the way, the game
	   is also over, but you lose.</p>
    <p>The game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse or both.  The movement is done using the
	   keyboard keypad if moving using the keyboard.  Num lock can be off or on.</p>
	<p>The game contains a built in evaluation process that will 'walk' the mine field for the player
	   and mark the bomb positions.  The evaluation starts from the current position and to the home
	   position.  The evaluation task uses the same logic a player would use and will stop once the
	   task is at a dead end and can't determine a good next move.  Once a player moves by that position,
	   can potentially have the evaluation re-ran from the new position if needed.  The game does keep
	   track if you use that function or not and will let you know if you win.</p>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Game Options:</div>
    <div>The game of Kaboooom! has several options that can affect behavior. Below is a description of
       each option and its effect.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Save Game On = If on, won't allow a player to go through 'marked' grid locations.  This is on
     	  by default.
      <li>Sounds On = Turns on/off incidental sounds used in the game. Default is off.
      <li>Verbose Evaluation = If the automatic evaluation button is pressed, this option controlls
	      the dialogs displayed during the evaluation.  Generally, if off, no dialogs are displayed
		  during the automatic evaluation.  If on, can get quite chatty during the evaluation process on
		  various issues or logic errors hit while doing the evaluation.  Default is off.
      <li>Confirmations On = If on, will display various yes/no prompts during game play.  Default is
	      off.
	  <li>Random Number of Bombs = If checked, when a new game is started, the number of bombs generated 
	      in the mine field is randomly calculated.  The number of bombs will be bewtwen 10 and 40 bombs.
		  If not checked, then the number of bombs entered in the next option is used and that will be the
		  number of bombs in the mine field.  If checked, the next field is disabled.  The default is
		  checked (on).  The number of bomb options only take effect in the next new game started.
	  <li>Number of Bombs = The number of bombs to use in the mine field when starting a new game.  This
	      option is not available is using the option to generate a random number of bombs.  If used, the
		  number of bombs must be between 10 and 40.  Default is 20.
    </ul>
